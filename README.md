# Python for Data Analysis Project

**Title**: An Analysis of Laptop Price Using Python

**Objective**: The objective of this project is to use Python to analyze a dataset of laptop price data from Flipkart and identify the factors that are most correlated with laptop price.

**Data**: The data for this project will be obtained from Flipkart. The dataset will contain laptop price data for all laptops sold on Flipkart in the past year.

**Methods**: The methods that will be used in this project include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and regression backward elimination. Data cleaning will be performed to remove any errors or inconsistencies in the data. Exploratory data analysis will be used to visualize the data and identify any patterns or trends. Hypothesis testing will be used to test the significance of the relationships between the independent variables and the dependent variable. Regression backward elimination will be used to identify the factors that are most correlated with laptop price.

**Results**: The results of this project will be a report that summarizes the findings of the analysis. The report will include a description of the data, the methods that were used, the results of the analysis, and the implications of the findings.

**Conclusion**: The conclusion of this project will discuss the implications of the findings and suggest areas for further research.
